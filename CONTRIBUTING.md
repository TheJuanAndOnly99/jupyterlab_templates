# JupyterLab Templates Contribution and Governance Policies

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `jupyterlab_templates`!

`jupyterlab_templates` is built on open source and hosted by the Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS). We invite you to participate in our community by adding and commenting on [issues](https://github.com/finos/jupyterlab_templates/issues) (e.g., bug reports; new feature suggestions) or contributing code enhancements through a pull request.

Note that commits and pull requests to FINOS repositories such as `jupyterlab_templates` may only be accepted from those contributors with a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Contribution+Compliance+Requirements#ContributionComplianceRequirements-ContributorLicenseAgreement) with FINOS. This may take the form of either:
* an active, executed Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) with FINOS, OR
* coverage under an existing, active Corporate Contribution License Agreement (CCLA) executed with FINOS (most likely by the developer's employer). Please note that some, though not all, CCLAs require individuals/employees to be explicitly named on the CCLA.

Commits from individuals not covered under an CLA can not be merged by `jupyterlab_templates`'s committers. We encourage you to check that you have a CLA in place well in advance of making your first pull request. 

Need an ICLA? Unsure if you are covered under an existing CCLA? Confused? Email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) and the foundation team will help get it sorted out for you. 

If you have any general questions about contributing to `jupyterlab_templates`, please feel free to open an issue on [github](https://github.com/finos/jupyterlab_templates/issues/new), or email [help@finos.org](mailto:finos.org).

### Reporting bugs, feature requests, etc.

To report bugs, request new features or similar, please open an issue on the Github
repository.

A good bug report includes:

- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce (preferably as minimal as possible)
- Possibly any output from the browser console (typically available via Ctrl + Shift + J or via F12).

### Minor changes, typos etc.

Minor changes can be contributed by navigating to the relevant files on the Github repository,
and clicking the "edit file" icon. By following the instructions on the page you should be able to
create a pull-request proposing your changes. A repository maintainer will then review your changes,
and either merge them, propose some modifications to your changes, or reject them (with a reason for
the rejection).

### Setting up a development environment

If you want to help resolve an issue by making some changes that are larger than that covered by the above paragraph, it is recommended that you:

- Fork the repository on Github
- Clone your fork to your computer
- Run the following commands inside the cloned repository:
  - `pip install -e .[dev]` - This will install the Python package in development
    mode.
  - `jupyter labextension install .` - This will add the lab extension development
    mode.
- Validate the install by running the tests:
  - `py.test` - This command will run the Python tests.
  - `yarn test` - This command will run the JS tests.

Once you have such a development setup, you should:

- Make the changes you consider necessary
- Run the tests to ensure that your changes does not break anything
- If you add new code, preferably write one or more tests for checking that your code works as expected.
- Commit your changes and publish the branch to your github repo.
- Open a pull-request (PR) back to the main repo on Github.

## Governance

### Roles

The project community consists of Contributors and Maintainers:
* A **Contributor** is anyone who submits a contribution to the project. (Contributions may include code, issues, comments, documentation, media, or any combination of the above.)
* A **Maintainer** is a Contributor who, by virtue of their contribution history, has been given write access to project repositories and may merge approved contributions.
* The **Lead Maintainer** is the project's interface with the FINOS team and Board. They are responsible for approving [quarterly project reports](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/#project-governing-board-reporting) and communicating on behalf of the project. The Lead Maintainer is elected by a vote of the Maintainers. 

### Contribution Rules

Anyone is welcome to submit a contribution to the project. The rules below apply to all contributions. (The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc. in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).)

* All contributions MUST be submitted as pull requests, including contributions by Maintainers.
* All pull requests SHOULD be reviewed by a Maintainer (other than the Contributor) before being merged.
* Pull requests for non-trivial contributions SHOULD remain open for a review period sufficient to give all Maintainers a sufficient opportunity to review and comment on them.
* After the review period, if no Maintainer has an objection to the pull request, any Maintainer MAY merge it.
* If any Maintainer objects to a pull request, the Maintainers SHOULD try to come to consensus through discussion. If not consensus can be reached, any Maintainer MAY call for a vote on the contribution.

### Maintainer Voting

The Maintainers MAY hold votes only when they are unable to reach consensus on an issue. Any Maintainer MAY call a vote on a contested issue, after which Maintainers SHALL have 36 hours to register their votes. Votes SHALL take the form of "+1" (agree), "-1" (disagree), "+0" (abstain). Issues SHALL be decided by the majority of votes cast. If there is only one Maintainer, they SHALL decide any issue otherwise requiring a Maintainer vote. If a vote is tied, the Lead Maintainer MAY cast an additional tie-breaker vote.

The Maintainers SHALL decide the following matters by consensus or, if necessary, a vote:
* Contested pull requests
* Election and removal of the Lead Maintainer
* Election and removal of Maintainers

All Maintainer votes MUST be carried out transparently, with all discussion and voting occurring in public, either:
* in comments associated with the relevant issue or pull request, if applicable;
* on the project mailing list or other official public communication channel; or
* during a regular, minuted project meeting.

### Maintainer Qualifications

Any Contributor who has made a substantial contribution to the project MAY apply (or be nominated) to become a Maintainer. The existing Maintainers SHALL decide whether to approve the nomination according to the Maintainer Voting process above.

### Changes to this Document

This document MAY be amended by a vote of the Maintainers according to the Maintainer Voting process above.
